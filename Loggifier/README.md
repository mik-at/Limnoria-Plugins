## Cleverbot.io

This plugin allows you to interface the Cleverbot.io API
It requires an ApiUser and ApiKey, which you need to get
from the cleverbot.io website and set into the config
registry. By default the plugin is activated by the
command @cleverbotio, but there is also an option to
make the plugin hook into invalid commands, to make
chatting with the bot easier.
